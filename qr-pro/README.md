# QR Pro Generator

QR Pro Generator is a lightweight, fast, and permanent QR Code Generator built for personal and business use.  
It creates QR codes that never expire because the data is embedded directly into the QR image, not routed through any external server.

This tool works on both mobile and desktop and can be hosted on any static hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or Hostinger.

## How it works

This QR generator does not use any third-party QR service.  
The QR code directly stores the information such as:

- https://designfuze.in  
- https://wa.me/91XXXXXXXXXX  
- tel:8084945254  

Because of this, the QR code will continue to work even years later.
